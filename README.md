        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>
            In this project, I successfully implemented a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model using BERT to predict whether questions asked on the Quora platform are sincere or insincere. Quora is a popular question-and-answer platform, and identifying insincere questions is crucial for maintaining the quality and integrity of the platform's content.

        <p>The project workflow consisted of the following key steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Understand NLP: I started by exploring the fundamentals of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and gained insights into the challenges and techniques involved in text classification tasks.</li>
            <li>Text Preprocessing: I performed essential text preprocessing tasks, such as tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming, to clean and prepare the textual data for further analysis.</li>
            <li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Performance Metrics: Through EDA, I gained a deeper understanding of the dataset and the distribution of classes. I also selected appropriate performance metrics to evaluate the model's predictions.</li>
            <li>Implementing BERT Model: I leveraged the power of BERT, a state-of-the-art NLP model, to build a robust classifier. BERT's bidirectional context-based representation proved to be highly effective for this text classification task.</li>
            <li>Making Valid Predictions: After training and fine-tuning the BERT model, I made predictions on a test dataset and evaluated its performance using the chosen metrics.</li>
        </ol>
